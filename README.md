<h1>Web Application Interface Design: Arora Creative</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This is an interace design project that I eventually used for my small business' website. Arora Creative is a design agency providing services to other small creative  businesses who require new logos, branding or social media. I aimed to meet usability goals by following usability heuristics, mainly focusing on the following heuristics: aesthetics and minimalism, visibility and feedback, efficiency and flexability and consistancy and standards.
